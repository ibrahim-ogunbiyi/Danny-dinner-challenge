# Introduction
Danny seriously love Janpanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decided to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favorite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny needed an assitant to help keep the restaurance stay afloat. The restaurant captured some very basic data from few months of their operation but have no idea of how to use the data to help them run the business.

# Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about how his customers patronized him, especially about their visiting patterns, how much each of them spent and their favorite items. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program. Additionally, he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL and any other analytical tool. Danny provided three key datasets for this case study;
<ol>
<li> Sales </li>
<li> Menu </li>
<li> Members </li>
</ol>
NB: No cleaning was made because the data provided is a clean data

# Business Question
